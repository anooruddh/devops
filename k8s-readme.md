# Kubernetes Notes

## Master Node Components
1. API Server 2. Controller Manager 3. ETCD 4. Scheduler

## Kubernetes Node Components
1.  Docker  2.  Container Runtime 3.  Kubelet 4.  Kubernetes Proxy Service

## The Control plane (master)
The Control plane is made up of the kube-api server, kube scheduler, cloud-controller-manager and kube-controller-manager. 
Kube proxies and kubelets live on each node, talking to the API and managing the workload of each node.

Cloud-controller-manager
The cloud-controller-manager runs in the control plane as a replicated set of processes (typically, these would be containers in Pods). 
The cloud-controller-manager is what allows you to connect your clusters with the cloud provider’s API and only runs controllers specific to the cloud provider you’re using.

Just note: If you’re running Kubernetes on-prem, your cluster won’t have a cloud-controller-manager.


## Etcd
etcd is a distributed key-value store and the primary datastore of Kubernetes. It stores and replicates the Kubernetes cluster state.

To run etcd, you first need to have a Kubernetes cluster and the command-line tool configured to communicate with said cluster.
