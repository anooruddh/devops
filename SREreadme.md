# What is SRE (site reliability engineering)?

### Overview
Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a software engineering approach to IT operations. SRE teams use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations tasks.

SRE takes the tasks that have historically been done by operations teams, often manually, and instead gives them to engineers or ops teams who use software and automation to solve problems and manage production systems. 

SRE is a valuable practice when creating scalable and highly reliable software systems. It helps you manage large systems through code, which is more scalable and sustainable for sysadmins managing thousands or hundreds of thousands of machines. 

The concept of site reliability engineering comes from the Google engineering team and is credited to Ben Treynor Sloss. 

SRE helps teams find a balance between releasing new features and making sure that they are reliable for users.

Standardization and automation are 2 important components of the SRE model. Site reliability engineers should always be looking for ways to enhance and automate operations tasks.

In this way, SRE helps to improve the reliability of a system today, while also improving it as it grows over time.

### What does a site reliability engineer do?
A site reliability engineer is a unique role that requires either a background as a software developer with additional operations experience, or as a sysadmin or in an IT operations role that also has software development skills. 

SRE teams are responsible for how code is deployed, configured, and monitored, as well as the availability, latency, change management, emergency response, and capacity management of services in production.

With SRE, 100% reliability is not expected; failure is planned for and accepted. 

Site reliability engineers split their time between operations tasks and project work. According to SRE best practices from Google, a site reliability engineer can only spend a maximum of 50% of their time on operations, which should be monitored to ensure they don’t go over. 

The rest of the time should be spent on development tasks like creating new features, scaling the system, and implementing automation.

Excess operational work and poorly performing services can be redirected back to the dev team to run instead of the site reliability engineer spending too much time on the operations of an application or service. 

Automation is an important part of the site reliability engineer’s role. If they are dealing with a problem repeatedly then they will automate a solution. This also helps ensure that operations work remains at half of their workload. 

Maintaining the balance between operations and development work is a key component of SRE. 

SRE is different because it relies on site reliability engineers within the development team who also have an operations background to remove communication and workflow problems.
