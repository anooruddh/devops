# What is Terraform?

HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

# Terraform Cloud

Terraform Cloud is the managed solution offered by Hashicorp to run Terraform configurations üí°. It is in some manner a ‚ÄúCI/CD tool‚Äù to manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It eliminates the need for you to configure a dedicated task in your CI/CD (Jenkins, Bamboo, Circle CI, etc.) and also provided a tailor-made UI, remote state management, and private module registry.

# Why Pipeline

Now you might be asking, ‚ÄúWhy should I add our Terraform configuration to GitHub Actions or other CI/CD Pipelines?‚Äù Here are some reasons:

Pipelines create more visibility. When working on managing infrastructure with Terraform on a team, you can easily see what is running and when it ran. When running locally, only you have that visibility.

Pipelines create traceability. When running Terraform in a pipeline, they usually store logs. This allows you to review old builds and their outputs at your convenience. 

Pipelines create repeatability. When you configure a pipeline, it should do the same action every time. This will make debugging and troubleshooting much easier.

And finally, they create simplicity. A pipeline can essentially take the place of your local instance. This way you don‚Äôt have to set up local dependencies and what not.

# Pipeline

The first thing you‚Äôll need to do before your GitHub Actions can run is to add your AWS credentials to the repository. To do this you will need to follow these steps:

Navigate to your repository and select the Settings tab.
Once there you should see on the left a Secrets section third from the bottom of the list, click on that.
Click on the New repository secret button.
Add your AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and click the Add secret button.
Repeat step 3 and add your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and click the Add secret button.

# WORKSPACES
In Terraform CLI, workspaces are separate instances of state data that can be used from the same working directory. You can use workspaces to manage multiple non-overlapping groups of resources with the same configuration. Every initialized working directory has at least one workspace.

## What is Terraform Workspace?

If we use the local backend for storing Terraform state, Terraform creates a file called terraform.tfstate to store the state of the applied configuration. However, in scenarios where you want to use the same configuration for different contexts, separate states might be necessary with same configuration.

Workspaces allows you to separate your state and infrastructure without changing anything in your code when you wanted the same exact code base to deploy to multiple environments without overlap. i.e. Workspaces help to create multiple state files for set of same terraform configuration file

## Key Points

With Workspaces, we can set deploy different environment with same terraform configuration files.

To manage multiple distinct sets of infrastructure resources (e.g. multiple environments), we can use Workspaces.

Workspaces isolate Terraform state. It is a best practice to have separate state per environment. Workspaces are technically equivalent to renaming your state file.

Workspaces ensure that the environments are isolated and mirrored.

Workspaces are the successor to old Terraform Environments.

Each of environments required separate state files to avoid collision. With the use of workspaces, you can prepend the workspace name to the path of the state file, ensuring each workspace (environment) had its own state.

## Commands:

  new, list, show, select and delete Terraform workspaces.

## Subcommands:
		delete    Delete a workspace
		
		list      List Workspaces
		
		new       Create a new workspace
		
		select    Select a workspace
		
		show      Show the name of the current workspace

examples:

		terraform workspace new Production
		
		terraform workspace select Production
		
		# Create deployment plan
		
		terraform plan -out prod.tfplan
		
		# Apply the deployment
		
		terraform apply "prod.tfplan"

Usage: 
Within your Terraform configuration, you may include the name of the current workspace using the ${terraform.workspace} interpolation sequence. This can be used anywhere where interpolations are allowed.

		resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
		bucket = "${var.bucket-name}-${terraform.workspace}"
		acl    = "private"
		}
		
## Default Workspace: 
If you don‚Äôt declare a workspace, Terraform uses a default workspace named default and it cannot ever be deleted. If you don‚Äôt specify workspace explicitly, it means you use default workspace.		

## Current Workspace Interpolation
Within your Terraform configuration, you may include the name of the current workspace using the ${terraform.workspace} interpolation sequence. This can be used anywhere interpolations are allowed.

## Advantages of workspace

- mantain different stages for different workspaces

- store these state  files in backend like azure,aws etc (A number of remote backends are supported, including Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage etc.)Remote backends solve many issues like Manual Error, Locking, Secrets etc.

- enable versioning on these state files

- shared by multiple members

- locking is possible

## Use of workspace Configuration

		provider "aws" {
		   region     = "eu-central-1"
		   access_key = "AKIATspmbXB2EPCJFO4Y"
		   secret_key = "AH9Hw//EfW6OJM8EFrWllkKdlgovpihIvYpu9TTxr"

		}

		locals {
		  instance_name = "${terraform.workspace}-instance" 
		}

		resource "aws_instance" "ec2_example" {

		    ami = "ami-0767046d1677be5a0" 

		    instance_type = var.instance_type

		    tags = {
		      Name = local.instance_name
		    }
		}

## When to use multiple terraform workspaces?

1.When you feel that you need a parallel, distinct copy of your infrastructure which you can test and verify in the development, test, and staging environment before putting it into the production environment.

2.If you have your infrastructure where each deployment requires you to put different setup credentials then you should not use Terraform workspaces for that.

# Terraform Environment Variables

ARM environment variable

	 ARM_ENDPOINT 
	 ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID 
	 ARM_TENANT_ID 
	 ARM_ACCESS_KEY 
	 ARM_CLIENT_ID 
	 ARM_CLIENT_SECRET 
	 
	 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
	 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
	 AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE

# What is a Backend

The primary function of a backend is to store the state created by Terraform runs after provisioning our resources. This gives Terraform a single place to look up what the expectation of our resources is from the last time we applied

# Backend Types

Local ‚Äî where the state file is stored on the local filesystem.

Remote ‚Äî where the state file is stored in some remote filesystem or database.

		terraform {
		  backend "azurerm" {
		    resource_group_name  = "rg-aus-prd-mom-state"
		    storage_account_name = "saausprdmomstate"
		    container_name       = "dev"
		    key                  = "mysteries-kubernetes.terraform.tfstate"
		  }
		}


# git-credential-cache - Helper to temporarily store passwords in memory

The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type your username or
password. For example:
You can provide options via the credential.helper configuration variable (this example
drops the cache time to 5 minutes):

           	$ git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=300'
