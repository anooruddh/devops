# What is Terraform?

HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

# Terraform Cloud

Terraform Cloud is the managed solution offered by Hashicorp to run Terraform configurations üí°. It is in some manner a ‚ÄúCI/CD tool‚Äù to manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It eliminates the need for you to configure a dedicated task in your CI/CD (Jenkins, Bamboo, Circle CI, etc.) and also provided a tailor-made UI, remote state management, and private module registry.

# Why Pipeline

Now you might be asking, ‚ÄúWhy should I add our Terraform configuration to GitHub Actions or other CI/CD Pipelines?‚Äù Here are some reasons:

Pipelines create more visibility. When working on managing infrastructure with Terraform on a team, you can easily see what is running and when it ran. When running locally, only you have that visibility.

Pipelines create traceability. When running Terraform in a pipeline, they usually store logs. This allows you to review old builds and their outputs at your convenience. 

Pipelines create repeatability. When you configure a pipeline, it should do the same action every time. This will make debugging and troubleshooting much easier.

And finally, they create simplicity. A pipeline can essentially take the place of your local instance. This way you don‚Äôt have to set up local dependencies and what not.

# Pipeline

The first thing you‚Äôll need to do before your GitHub Actions can run is to add your AWS credentials to the repository. To do this you will need to follow these steps:

Navigate to your repository and select the Settings tab.
Once there you should see on the left a Secrets section third from the bottom of the list, click on that.
Click on the New repository secret button.
Add your AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and click the Add secret button.
Repeat step 3 and add your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and click the Add secret button.
